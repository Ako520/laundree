      <h2>Family</h2>
      We're Christian and Malene, a mid-twenties computer geek couple, who have
      found a common passion in saving the world one load of laundry at a time.
      <br/>
      Christian is a fulltime software developer at a small startup company. He is a
      passionate web developer and is always staying up-to-date on what is new and hot
      on the WWW.
      <br/>
      Malene is a fulltime PhD-student in computer science. She loves exploring the
      posibilities of data and wants to nudge the world into a more environmentally
      friendly place with data.
      <br/>
      Our common backgrounds gave us the opportunity to start Laundree together, which
      we now spend most of our spare time on. We love to work together with other people,
      so our project is OpenSource on Github and we highly recommend anyone to help contribute!
      <br/>
      Of course, we value privacy and anonymity, keeping our users' data secret and safe.

      <h2>Mission</h2>
      Our mission is two-fold; we want the daily lives of our landlords and tenants to
      become easier and much more enjoyable by building a platform supporting laundry facilities
      and also the communication between landlords and tenants.
      <br/>
      We also want to improve the environment by encouring more people to share their laundry
      facilities while nudging peope to wash at times during the day that are more environmentally
      friendly by analysing anonymised data collected from our users.
